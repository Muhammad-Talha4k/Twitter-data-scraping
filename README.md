# Twitter/X Data Scraping using Snscrape
This project demonstrates how to use Python's snscrape library that allows you to scrape data from Twitter/x without using the twitter/x developers account. You can use this project to extract tweets, user profiles, metadata, and other relevant information from Twitter/x based on specific search criteria, hashtags, or user profiles.

## Requirements

 snscrape requires Python 3.8 or higher. The Python package dependencies are installed automatically when you install snscrape, to install snscrape write the following in the cmd
 ``` bash
 pip3 install snscrape
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Talha4k/Twitter-data-scraping.git
  ```

## Usage 

1. snscrape is a scraper for social networking services (SNS). It scrapes things like user profiles, hashtags, or searches and returns the discovered items, e.g. the relevant posts.

2. You can scrape Twitter/x's: users, user profiles, hashtags, searches (live tweets, top tweets, and users), tweets (single or surrounding thread), list posts, communities, and trends.
